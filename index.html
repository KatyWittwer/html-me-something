            <h2>About My Launchcode Journey</h2>
                <p> I began the LC101 class in January 2017 and will complete the
                    coursework in June before starting a final, independent project.
                    My goal is to become a Python and Javascript master and
                    enhance my web development skills.</p>

                <p>My love of technology dates back to when I was five years old and my
                Grandpa, who was an Educational Technology guru, brought
                home one of the first Apple IIe computers. I instantly fell head over heels
                as soon as I started clacking away on the keyboard and watching the magic
                happen.</p>
